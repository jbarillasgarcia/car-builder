# Car Builder
Sample application demonstrating the use of Builder Design Pattern.

## TODO
1. Allow the programmer to customize the car. For example: build a car with automatic transmission and MT tires. You can use the Factory design pattern for each part.
2. Display the unit price for the part in the invoice description and subtotal for each line.
3. Include a VAT (tax rate) to the constructor of the invoice builder and use it to calculate and display the TOTAL WITHOUT TAX and TOTAL WITH TAXES (Remove the current total)
4. Beautify the invoice by adding your own graphical design elements.
